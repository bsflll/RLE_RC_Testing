## Researcher: Christina Lee, Prof. Lizhong Zheng, Xiangxiang Xu

## Abstract:
Reservoir Computing (RC) has emerged as a versatile machine learning technique, finding applications in a wide range of domains, 
e.g., Time Series Prediction, Pattern Recognition and Image Processing, Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI). 
Despite its various adoption, a critical aspect that has been largely overlooked is the algorithm's design, 
particularly concerning the influence of parameters in different applications. 
In this paper, we address this gap by conducting an extensive analysis of RC’s performance under multiple factors, 
including activation functions, initialization techniques, parameter settings, and data types. 
Our aim is to provide valuable guidance to algorithm designers who are considering the adoption of RC in their applications.

To facilitate our investigation, we create a robust testing environment capable of evaluating RC performance under diverse parameter configurations. 
Specifically, data is generated from a compact Echo State Network (ESN) model to provide an in-depth examination of how different activation functions 
affect the reservoir's capabilities in handling nonlinear tasks. For instance, we compare common activation functions such as sigmoid, tanh, ReLU, 
and their variants, aiming to uncover the most effective choices for capturing nonlinearities. 
Throughout our study, we systematically explore the interplay between various activation functions and essential parameters, 
including weight setting, hidden layer, reservoir spectral scaling, and input connectivity. By focusing on tasks with inherent nonlinearity, 
we gain a deeper understanding of the strengths and limitations of each part of the algorithm, shedding light on their impact on RC's overall applicability.

The insights derived from our analysis yield valuable contributions in RC algorithm design. 
Researchers and practitioners can leverage our findings to select appropriate settings tailored to their specific tasks, 
ultimately leading to improved RC models for real-world applications, 
encouraging the broader adoption and exploration of this powerful machine learning paradigm.
